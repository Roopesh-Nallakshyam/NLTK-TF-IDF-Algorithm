# NLTK-TF-IDF-Algorithm
I extracted the text data from resumes and then applied TF-IDF (Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency) which tells how rare the word present in resumes based on that tf-idf score will come so that we predict that word as rare word and then we use it for classifying resumes.
